## Overview

This packages contains data collected as part a research study at Queen
Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) in Blantyre Malawi. Particulate matter
measurements (PM 2.5 & PM 10) were taken in 5-minute intervals for at
eight sensor locations over two months.

## Manuscript

This data was used for a manuscript subitted to Habitat International
journal. The underlying code can be found in a separate repository. The
`manuscript.qmd` is reproducible.

## Installation

You can install the development version of qechairquality from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Global-Health-Engineering/qechairquality")
```

Alternatively, you can download the individual datasets as a CSV or XLSX
file from the table below.
