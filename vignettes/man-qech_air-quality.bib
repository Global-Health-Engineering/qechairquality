  abstract = {Air quality in cities of Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries has deteriorated with the situation driven by rapid population growth and its attendant increased vehicle ownership, increased use of solid fuels for cooking and heating, and poor waste management practices. Industrial expansion in these cities is also a major contributor to the worsening air pollution. Exposure to ambient air pollution is a major threat to human health in SSA with 176,000 deaths and 626,000 DALYs in the region attributable to ambient air pollution exposure. These estimates are however likely to be much higher than reported due to the limited data emanating from the region. Recently, the adoption of the World Health Assembly resolution on air pollution and health, and Sustainable Development Goals are a welcome boost for urban air pollution control efforts in SSA. In this article, we have outlined within the broad framework of these international policy instruments, measures for addressing urban air pollution and its associated health impacts in SSA sustainably.},

  abstract = {The World Health Organization estimates that particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to approximately 800,000 premature deaths each year, ranking it the 13th leading cause of mortality worldwide. However, many studies show that the relationship is deeper and far more complicated than originally thought. PM is a portion of air pollution that is made up of extremely small particles and liquid droplets containing acids, organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. PM is categorized by size and continues to be the fraction of air pollution that is most reliably associated with human disease. PM is thought to contribute to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease by the mechanisms of systemic inflammation, direct and indirect coagulation activation, and direct translocation into systemic circulation. The data demonstrating PM's effect on the cardiovascular system are strong. Populations subjected to long-term exposure to PM have a significantly higher cardiovascular incident and mortality rate. Short-term acute exposures subtly increase the rate of cardiovascular events within days of a pollution spike. The data are not as strong for PM's effects on cerebrovascular disease, though some data and similar mechanisms suggest a lesser result with smaller amplitude. Respiratory diseases are also exacerbated by exposure to PM. PM causes respiratory morbidity and mortality by creating oxidative stress and inflammation that leads to pulmonary anatomic and physiologic remodeling. The literature shows PM causes worsening respiratory symptoms, more frequent medication use, decreased lung function, recurrent health care utilization, and increased mortality. PM exposure has been shown to have a small but significant adverse effect on cardiovascular, respiratory, and to a lesser extent, cerebrovascular disease. These consistent results are shown by multiple studies with varying populations, protocols, and regions. The data demonstrate a dose-dependent relationship between PM and human disease, and that removal from a PM-rich environment decreases the prevalence of these diseases. While further study is needed to elucidate the effects of composition, chemistry, and the PM effect on susceptible populations, the preponderance of data shows that PM exposure causes a small but significant increase in human morbidity and mortality. Most sources agree on certain ``common sense'' recommendations, although there are lonely limited data to support them. Indoor PM exposure can be reduced by the usage of air conditioning and particulate filters, decreasing indoor combustion for heating and cooking, and smoking cessation. Susceptible populations, such as the elderly or asthmatics, may benefit from limiting their outdoor activity during peak traffic periods or poor air quality days. These simple changes may benefit individual patients in both short-term symptomatic control and long-term cardiovascular and respiratory complications.}

  abstract = {Ambient air pollution in urban cities in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is an important public health problem with models and limited monitoring data indicating high concentrations of pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5). On most global air quality index maps, however, information about ambient pollution from SSA is scarce. We evaluated the feasibility and practicality of longitudinal measurements of ambient PM2.5 using low-cost air quality sensors (Purple Air-II-SD) across thirteen locations in seven countries in SSA. Devices were used to gather data over a 30-day period with the aim of assessing the efficiency of its data recovery rate and identifying challenges experienced by users in each location. The median data recovery rate was 94\% (range: 72\% to 100\%). The mean 24 h concentration measured across all sites was 38 \textmu g/m3 with the highest PM2.5 period average concentration of 91 \textmu g/m3 measured in Kampala, Uganda and lowest concentrations of 15 \textmu g/m3 measured in Faraja, The Gambia. Kampala in Uganda and Nnewi in Nigeria recorded the longest periods with concentrations {$>$}250 \textmu g/m3. Power outages, SD memory card issues, internet connectivity problems and device safety concerns were important challenges experienced when using Purple Air-II-SD sensors. Despite some operational challenges, this study demonstrated that it is reasonably practicable and feasible to establish a network of low-cost devices to provide data on local PM2.5 concentrations in SSA countries. Such data are crucially needed to raise public, societal and policymaker awareness about air pollution across SSA.},

  abstract = {While numerous studies have demonstrated that shortterm exposure to particulate matter (PM*) is associated with adverse health effects, the characteristics of PM that cause harm are not well understood, and PM toxicity may vary by its chemical composition. This study investigates whether spatial and temporal patterns in PM health effect estimates based on total mass can be explained by spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the chemical composition of the particles. A database of 52 chemical components of PM with an aerodynamic diameter \&lt; or = 2.5 pm (PM2.5) was constructed for 187 U.S. counties, for 2000 through 2005, based on data from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) monitoring networks. Components that covary with PM2.5 total mass and/or are large contributors to PM2.5, total mass were identified using actual and seasonally detrended data. Using Bayesian hierarchical modeling, seasonal and temporal variation in PM2.5 and the risk of total, cardiovascular, and respiratory hospital admissions were investigated for persons \&gt; or = 65 years in 202 U.S. counties for 1999 through 2005. Seasonal variation was investigated using three model structures with different underlying assumptions about the relationship between PM2.5 and hospitalizations. The findings of this study indicate higher effects in winter for both causes of hospitalization, and higher effects in the Northeast for cardiovascular admissions, although 53\% of the counties were in this region. Higher PM2.5 effect estimates for cardiovascular or respiratory hospitalizations were observed in seasons and counties with a higher PM2.5 content of nickel (Ni), vanadium (V), or EC. Mortality effect estimates for PM with an aerodynamic diameter \&lt; or = 10 pm (PM10) were higher in seasons and counties with higher PM2.5 Ni content. The association between the Ni content of PM2.5 and effect estimates for cardiovascular hospitalization was robust to adjustment by EC, V, or both EC and V. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in the fraction of PM2.5 that is Ni was associated with a 14.9\% (PI, 3.4-26.4) increase in the relative rates of cardiovascular hospital admissions associated with PM2.5 total mass adjusted for EC and V. No associations were observed between PM total mass health effect estimates and community-level variables for socioeconomic status, racial composition, or urbanicity. Communities with a higher prevalence of central AC had lower PM2.5 effect estimates for cardiovascular hospital admissions. The findings of this study indicate strong spatial and temporal variation in the chemical composition of the particle mixture and in the regional and seasonal variation in health effect estimates for PM2.5 total mass. The chemical composition of particles partially explained the heterogeneity of effect estimates. Observed associations could be related to the components themselves, to other components, or to a combination of components that share similar sources. The findings do not exclude the possibility that other components or characteristics of PM are harmful. The limitations of this study include the use of community-level aggregated data for exposure and for the variables used to investigate alternate hypotheses. Also, particle components and chemical forms (e.g., ammonium sulfate) not measured in the U.S. EPA database were not included. PM10 results in particular should be viewed with caution as the time frame of measurement and PM size fraction are different for the chemical composition and health effects data. A better understanding of the particular chemical components or sources that are most harmful to health can help decision-makers develop more targeted air pollution regulations and can aid in understanding the biological mechanisms by which air pollution-related health effects occur, thereby informing future research.},

This paper identifies pollutant concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) emission and air quality index categories with the peak hour interval on Hidar Sitaten day, and present analysis of air quality in Addis Ababa from August 2016 to November 2019. Daily records, with a 1-hour interval, of raw concentration of air pollutant and air quality index data, were obtained from the AirNow website of Addis Ababa central monitoring station. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics of the mean air quality index and concentration of PM2.5. Accordingly, the study revealed that the peak hour for high pollutant concentration emission ranges between 8\,pm to 11\,pm hours, and the mean air quality index was more than a moderate level. Particularly, on Hidar Sitaten in 2019 at 9\,pm the maximum concentration of PM2.5 was 8.6 times higher than WHO air quality guideline standard of daily allowance. The highest mean of air quality index and concentration of PM2.5 recorded was 112 and 44.2\,\textmu g/m3 on 21 November 2017, respectively, and it was found to be unhealthy for sensitive groups. This implies that the concentration of PM2.5 was harmful to people who are unusually sensitive to particulate pollution and have health problems. Therefore, public participation and strong regulations are needed on air quality management to strike a balance between a cultural practice of Hidar Sitaten and healthy air quality.},

This article assessed the current status of solid waste management in LDCs from waste generation to disposal. Solid waste generation in LDCs averages 0.56 kg/capita/day while the solid waste stream consists mainly of organics (52\%) followed by recyclables (26\%). Waste collection is also low and due to irregular waste collection, many people in LDCs resort to illegal practices such as illegal dumping or open burning of wastes. Sanitary landfilling is almost non-existent in LDCs with some of the few landfills present severely lacking in effective leachate or gas collection systems. While recycling is carried out in some LDCs, the most common practice is to collect recyclables for exportation. Similarly, composting of solid waste exists mainly on small-scale while biogas plants present in LDCs are used mostly for treatment of animal manure. Some of the challenges faced by LDCs include lack of funding, infrastructure, legislations, knowledge, and awareness on solid waste issues. However, there is a huge potential for job creation in the solid waste management field including waste collection, recycling, composting and even sanitary landfilling.},

Limited local data are a barrier to the formulation and evaluation of policies to reduce air and noise pollution.                                         Methods and analysis                                We designed a year-long measurement campaign to characterise air and noise pollution and their sources at high-resolution within the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), Ghana. Our design uses a combination of fixed (year-long, n=10) and rotating (week-long, n =\textasciitilde 130) sites, selected to represent a range of land uses and source influences (eg, background, road traffic, commercial, industrial and residential areas, and various neighbourhood socioeconomic classes). We will collect data on fine particulate matter (PM                 2.5                 ), nitrogen oxides (NO                 x                 ), weather variables, sound (noise level and audio) along with street-level time-lapse images. We deploy low-cost, low-power, lightweight monitoring devices that are robust, socially unobtrusive, and able to function in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) climate. We will use state-of-the-art methods, including spatial statistics, deep/machine learning, and processed-based emissions modelling, to capture highly resolved temporal and spatial variations in pollution levels across the GAMA and to identify their potential sources. This protocol can serve as a prototype for other SSA cities.                                                        Ethics and dissemination               This environmental study was deemed exempt from full ethics review at Imperial College London and the University of Massachusetts Amherst; it was approved by the University of Ghana Ethics Committee (ECH 149/18-19). This protocol is designed to be implementable in SSA cities to map environmental pollution to inform urban planning decisions to reduce health harming exposures to air and noise pollution. It will be disseminated through local stakeholder engagement (public and private sectors), peer-reviewed publications, contribution to policy documents, media, and conference presentations.},

An analysis of literature on the work done and reported mainly in publications from 2005 to 2011, related to waste management in developing countries, showed that few articles give quantitative information. The analysis was conducted in two of the major scientific journals, Waste Management Journal and Waste Management and Research. The objective of this research was to determine the stakeholders' action/behavior that have a role in the waste management process and to analyze influential factors on the system, in more than thirty urban areas in 22 developing countries in 4 continents. A combination of methods was used in this study in order to assess the stakeholders and the factors influencing the performance of waste management in the cities. Data was collected from scientific literature, existing data bases, observations made during visits to urban areas, structured interviews with relevant professionals, exercises provided to participants in workshops and a questionnaire applied to stakeholders. Descriptive and inferential statistic methods were used to draw conclusions. The outcomes of the research are a comprehensive list of stakeholders that are relevant in the waste management systems and a set of factors that reveal the most important causes for the systems' failure. The information provided is very useful when planning, changing or implementing waste management systems in cities.},

Results show that CO level (2.47 {$\pm$} 1.23 mg m-3) were below the Malawian limit~value (10.31 mg m-3).

Discernible variations in~hourly, diurnal, monthly and seasonal CO, SO2 and NO2 were apparent. Independent t-test confirmed~that day time values were higher than those at night (p {$<$} 0.05). Thus, variations in local weather affect~the disparity in hourly and diurnal values. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed significant variations~in monthly observations. Moreover, independent t-test showed that wet season CO (2.32 mg m-3), SO2~(5.10 mg m-3) and NO2 (9.41 mg m-3) levels were higher than dry season values (CO = 2.32 mg m-3; SO2 =~3.42 mg m-3; NO2 = 8.13 mg m-3). A hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) divided the 10 months into three~groups based on distribution of CO, SO2 and NO2, air temperature, wind speed and wind direction.~Furthermore, factor analysis (FA) showed that air temperature had significant contribution to variations~in mean values of CO, SO2 and NO2 for the entire study period.

This study reports on associations between daily ambient air pollutant concentrations and the respiratory symptoms of schoolchildren living in Durban, South Africa. This city is Africa's busiest port and a key hub for imported crude oil and exported refined petroleum and petrochemical products, and it experiences a mixture of air pollutants that reflects emissions from industry, traffic and biomass burning. Children in four communities in the highly industrialized southern portion of the city were compared to children of similar socio-economic profiles living in the north of the city. One school was selected in each community. A total of 423 children were recruited. Symptom logs were completed every 1.5e2 h over 3-week period in each of four seasons. Ambient concentrations of NO2, NO, SO2, CO, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 were measured throughout the study. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and assess lag effects (1e5 days) using single pollutant (single lags or distributed lags) models. Concentrations of SO2 and NOx were markedly higher in the south, while PM10 did not vary. Significant increase in the odds ratios of cough were identified for the various lags analyzed. The OR of symptoms was further increased among those living in the south compared to the north. In conclusion, in this analysis of over 70,000 observations, we provide further evidence that exposure to PM10, SO2, NO2 and NO is associated with significantly increased occurrence of respiratory symptoms among children. This was evident for cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, across the four pollutants and for different lags of exposure. This is the first study describing these changes in sub-Saharan Africa.},

  abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles that are suspended in air. These particles typically consist of a mixture of inorganic and organic chemicals, including carbon, sulfates, nitrates, metals, acids, and semi-volatile compounds. The size of PM in air ranges from approximately 0.005 to 100 micrometers (\textmu m) in diameter -- the size of just a few atoms to about the thickness of a human hair. Researchers have defined size categories for these particles differently. PM is defined by three general categories commonly used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA): coarse (10 to 2.5 \textmu m), fine (2.5 \textmu m or smaller), and ultrafine (0.1 \textmu m or smaller). Research suggests that particle size is an important factor that influences how particles deposit in the respiratory tract and affect human health. Coarse particles are deposited almost exclusively in the nose and throat; whereas, fine and ultrafine particles generally are able to penetrate to deep areas of the lung. Fine and ultrafine particles are present in greater numbers and have greater surface area than larger particles of the same mass, and they are generally considered to be more toxic. Most countries contribute to aiborne particulate matter pollution in other countries. In the past couple of years particulate matter has recieved media attention, concequential to the discovery of thousand of people dying young of particulate matter introduced health effects. This includes both short-term and long-term effects. Particulate matter does not only cause health effects, it also plays a role in the green house effect and global warming because of its contribution to cloud formation. Particulate matter is released from natural sources, such as volcanic eruptions, sea salt, or soils. Anthropogenic sources, such as car exhausts, industry, shipping and coal and ore fabrication, cause increases in airborne particulate matter concentrations on many locations. Deposition of these particulate matters on vegetated surfaces depend on the size distribution of these particles and effects of particulate matter on vegetation may be associated with the reduction in light required for photosynthesis and increase in leaf temperature due to changed surface optical properties.},

  abstract = {Solid waste management remains a challenge globally attributed to several factors including inadequacies and ineffectiveness of policies. Presumably, good policies should translate to better solid waste management prac\- tices. However, other underlying factors and implementation challenges may determine the waste management status. Thus the debate in the literature on solid waste management policy and practice remains inconclusive. Based on literature review, this paper examines the discourse on solid waste management regulation and status in Sub-Saharan Africa. A paradox of policy outcomes is revealed at global and national level. Global policies have not been holistically contextualised and integrated in national policies. While national policies have not improved the solid waste management status of some countries, in others, it has, albeit unsustainably. Notably, inherent weaknesses such as insufficiency, homogeneity and ambiguity of policies affects implementation. This is exacerbated by poor enforcement strategies, lack of participatory mechanisms, inadequate sensitisation, influ\- ence of power and politics, as well as weak political commitment, among others. To ensure smart and clean cities, it is crucial for initiatives of solid waste management not only to be legally supported, but also contextualised and co-generated. For effective policy implementation, there is need for sensitisation of urban dwellers to enable comprehension of policies. Participatory strategies and governments' commitment towards solid waste man\- agement should be paramount. Due to rapid changes in urban areas, periodic studies on content and context inferences such as solid waste collection practices and participation of actors in the informal settlements are required to dispel the practice of homogenising policies in order to enhance relevancy and suitability.},

Methods\textemdash Primary schools from within each of seven communities in two regions of Durban (the highly industrialised south compared with the non-industrial north) were selected. Children from randomly selected grade 4 classrooms were invited to participate. Standardised interviews, spirometry, methacholine challenge testing and skin-prick testing were conducted. Particulate matter (PM), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide were monitored at each school, while nitrogen oxides (NOx) and other pollutants were monitored at other sites. Results\textemdash SO2 was significantly higher in the south than in the north, while PM concentrations were similar across the city. The prevalence of symptoms consistent with asthma of any severity was 32.1\%. Covariate-adjusted prevalences were higher among children from schools in the south than among those from the north for persistent asthma (12.2\% v. 9.6 \%) and for marked airway hyperreactivity (AHR) (8.1\% v. 2.8\%), while SO2 resulted in a twofold increased risk of marked AHR (95\% confidence interval 0.98 \textendash{} 4.66; p=0.056). Conclusions\textemdash Schoolchildren from industrially exposed communities experienced higher covariate-adjusted prevalences of persistent asthma and marked AHR than children from communities distant from industrial sources. Our findings are strongly suggestive of industrial pollution-related adverse respiratory health effects among these children.},

The relations of life cycle indictors with driving factors, including economic level, geographical location, urbanization and solid waste legislation process, are discussed. The results present that the major indicators had obvious regional differences, which can divide Africa into three levels: North Africa and South Africa {$>$} West Africa and Central Africa {$>$} East Africa. Besides, the disposal methods in North Africa, South Africa and West Africa have evolved from simple open dumping to sanitary landfill, composting and recycle treatment, while opening dumping is still rampant in East Africa. With a combination tool of Principal Component Analysis and Multiple Linear Regression, it was identified that eco\- nomic growth, urbanization and geographical location are the most critical factors influencing the unbalanced statue of MSW management in Africa. By cluster analysis, unbalance status of MSW management in African countries can be integrated into three grades of MSW management level: good, fair and poor.},

  abstract = {Poor air quality is a development challenge. Urbanization and industrial development along with increased populations have brought clear socio-economic benefits to Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) but can also bring disadvantages such as decreasing air quality. A lack of reliable air quality data in East African cities makes it difficult to understand air pollution exposure and to predict future air quality trends. This work documents urban air quality and air pollution exposure in the capital cities of Kampala (Uganda), Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) and Nairobi (Kenya). We build a situational awareness of air pollution through repeated static and dynamic mobile monitoring in a range of urban locations, including urban background, roadside (pavement and building), rural background, and bus station sites, alongside vehicle-based measurements including buses and motorcycle taxis. Data suggest that the measured particulate matter mass concentrations (PM2.5, PM10) in all studied cities was at high concentrations, and often hazardous to human health, as defined by WHO air quality guidelines. Overall, the poorest air quality was observed in Kampala, where mean daily PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were significantly above the WHO limits at urban background locations by 122\% and 69\% and at roadside locations by 193\% and 215\%, respectively. Traffic is clearly a major contributor to East African urban air pollution; monitoring in Kampala and Addis Ababa, on motorcycle taxis, in buses and at bus stations indicated that drivers and commuters were exposed to poor air quality throughout their commute. Road-related air pollution can also impact indoor locations near roads. Using one exemplar building located within Nairobi's Central Business District, it is shown that measured outdoor PM concentrations significantly correlate with the indoor air quality (r=0.84). This link between roadside emissions and indoor air pollution within buildings located close to the road should be explored more fully. This study, through a series of case studies, provides clear evidence that roads and traffic need to be a focus for mitigation strategies to reduce air pollution exposure in East African cities.},

The rapid pace of increase in population, economic growth, urbanization and industrialization is coupled with accelerated solid waste generation. In most of the developing countries wastes are either scattered in urban centers or disposed off unplanned in low lying areas or open dumps. The lack of infrastructure for collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of solid waste, proper solid waste management planning, insufficient financial resources, technical expertise and public attitude have made the situation exasperating due to which several environmental and health related problems are increasing. Though, there are many negative issues related to solid waste, it also provides many opportunities that not only mitigates its negative impact but also helps in meeting the demand for energy and employment generation as well as in soil health improvement. Keeping in mind the present situation the current review was planned with the objective to overlook the challenges and opportunities faced during urban solid waste management in developing countries like India.},

These emissions, however, are not included in many current emission inventories used for chemistry and climate modeling applications. This paper presents the first comprehensive and consistent estimates of the global emissions of greenhouse gases, particulate matter, reactive trace gases, and toxic compounds from open waste burning. Global emissions of CO2 from open waste burning are relatively small compared to total anthropogenic CO2; however, regional CO2 emissions, particularly in many developing countries in Asia and Africa, are substantial. Further, emissions of reactive trace gases and particulate matter from open waste burning are more significant on regional scales. For example, the emissions of PM10 from open domestic waste burning in China is equivalent to 22\% of China's total reported anthropogenic PM10 emissions. The results of the emissions model presented here suggest that emissions of many air pollutants are significantly underestimated in current inventories because open waste burning is not included, consistent with studies that compare model results with available observations.},
